# Webscraping-books
This project is for keeping track of prices of a light novel series on Amazon and Book depository, it just needs to be running and it will fetch the prices and input them into an SQL database.
I also added a few gpus as with the release of the next generation I am curious to see the effect on the price of the current generation.
Done in Python using requests, BeautifulSoup and postgres packages. 
Future goals include collecting data for a few months then looking at some presentation(probably a graph) to look for trends.
